âœŽ #### Must know:

##### Camel Notation:

The first letter of the first word will be always lowercase and the first letter of every word after is uppercase.

Example: oneTwoThreeFour

##### Pascal Notation:

The first letter of ever word should be uppercase.

Example: OneTwoThreeFour

##### Carbage Collection:

The garbage collector figures out what variables or constants are no longer used and then deallocate the memory that was allocated to them earlier.

Memory allocation and deallocation automatically happens behind the scenes, and developers have no control over it.

##### Template Literals:

Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.
You can find more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).
